### Note!
Not maintained since 2012. Unfinished project, main problem word wraping.

### Description
Subclass of UITextView with syntax highlighting for iOS 5.0, not completed.

With new iOS 6.0 syntax highlighting became trivial thing. Because *[UITextView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/uitextview_class/Reference/UITextView.html)* has attribute *[attributedText](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/uitextview_class/Reference/UITextView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UITextView/attributedText)*, which has enough parameters and functionality for it.
