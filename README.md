### Description
Subclass of UITextView with syntax highlighting for iOS 5.0, not finished (just sample)

With new iOS 6.0 any junior developer can do code editor application with syntax highlighting. Because *[UITextView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/uitextview_class/Reference/UITextView.html)* has attribute *[attributedText](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/uitextview_class/Reference/UITextView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UITextView/attributedText)*, which has enough parameters and functionality for it.

So, I want to say, my old project does not have sense anymore. :)

The last build shared on git hub and everyone can modify it and try to finish, because it still not completed. Still has a problem with word wrap.

Maybe someone will get something new for himself. Because this project used CoreText and CoreGraphics framework.

Enjoy!
